# Movie API Frontend

This is the **React Bootstrap frontend** for my Movie API project. This project is part of my learning journey, following the [FreeCodeCamp Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ&list=PLVW06SVN1dvGOv_wWUjDaVaufAsDgt-UG&index=13).

## Features
- Displaying a list of movies.
- Adding and displaying reviews.

### Known Issue
There is currently a **bug in the review-adding functionality**. I am actively working on resolving this issue and hope to fix it soon.

### Backend Repository
The backend for this project is built using **Spring Boot** and can be found [here](<backend-repo-url>).
